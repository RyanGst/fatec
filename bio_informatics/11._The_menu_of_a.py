# Write an algorithm that reads the code of the item ordered,
# the quantity and calculates the amount to be paid for that snack Consider that for each run, only one item will be calculated

# Description Code Price
# Cachorro Quente 100 1.20
# Bauru Simples 101 1.30
# Bauru com Ovo 102 1.50
# Hamb√∫rguer 103 1.20
# Cheeseburguer 104 1.30
# Refrigerante 105 1.00
